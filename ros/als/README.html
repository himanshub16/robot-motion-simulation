<h2>1. Setup pub-sub connections as per a given graph</h2>

<p>Given a graph as shown in image below, setup talker and subscriber nodes such that they transfer messages so that the connection graph appears as the image.
<img src="ros/als/scripts/1-pub-sub-graph.png" alt="pub-sub-graph" title="" /></p>

<p>The solution reads the config graph from a json file and for each node prepares a list of nodes the current one will <code>talk to</code> and <code>listen to</code>.</p>

<p>After this, it starts each node in a different process, using Python's <code>multiprocessing</code>.</p>

<p>```bash
cd scripts</p>

<h1>Update the graph in connection-graph.json, if you want a different setup</h1>

<p>python start-talking.py</p>

<h1>To view the graph, run below cmd in another shell</h1>

<p>rosrun rqt<em>graph rqt</em>graph
```</p>

<h2>2. Move a robot in MobileSim to a fixed goal</h2>

<p>Given a goal, say <code>(0, 5)</code>, a robot in MobileSim needs to move from one point to another.
```bash</p>

<h1>Run these commands in different shells/windows</h1>

<h1>Start roscore service</h1>

<p>roscore</p>

<h1>Start MobileSim</h1>

<p>MobileSim -r pioneer-lx --nomap</p>

<h1>Start RosAria</h1>

<p>rosrun rosaria RosAria</p>

<h1>Start the required script</h1>

<p>python scripts/2-move-to-goal.py
```</p>
