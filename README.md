# ALS Lab assignments

This repository contains code written for the lab of [Artificial Life Simulation course](http://rkala.in/als.php) (part of Robotics, my masters specialization).

The work can be divided into two sections:
- **Simulating behaviour of agent(s) moving in a plane** (pre-midsem)
  [code](/canvas)
  This part comprise of tasks where one or more agents have a goal to reach, or behave in coordination in a given plane. 
  The implementation was done using [HTML5 Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API).

- **Simulating agents in ROS** (post-midsem)
  [code](/ros/als)
  This part comprise of tasks where a specific behaviour was to be simulated on one or more robots in [ROS](http://www.ros.org/).
  The aim here was to understand the basics of ROS, with message passing to control robots using `RosAria` and `MobileSim`.
